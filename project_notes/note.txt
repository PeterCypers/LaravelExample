php artisen serve doesn't work, so I use:
php -S localhost:8000 -t public



it's all that's needed to see the views from the guide,

there is also:
npm run dev

this is ran in a seperate terminal from the previous command and should be the hot module replacement front-end (with vite) server


useful command to see where all the path variables are pointing to:
$env:PATH -split ";"
